# Foodition Problem Statement

Global hunger and food insecurity have increased significantly since 2015, mainly due to factors such as pandemics, conflict, climate change and inequality. By 2022, an estimated 735 million people, or 9.2% of the world's population, will be chronically hungry, representing a marked increase from 2019. Furthermore, around 2.4 billion people face moderate to severe levels of food insecurity by that year, indicating a lack of access to sufficient food. This calls for coordinated global attention and efforts to address this growing humanitarian crisis, as hunger and malnutrition pose serious obstacles to sustainable development.
On the other hand, the problem of food waste also worsens the situation with around 1.3 billion tons of food wasted worldwide every year. In Indonesia, annual food waste reaches 23-48 million tons, equivalent to 115-184 kilograms per capita, which contributes to 7.29 percent of Indonesia's greenhouse gas emissions. This problem has a considerable economic impact, causing an annual loss of IDR 213-551 trillion, or 4-5 percent of Indonesia's GDP, with the highest economic loss occurring at the food waste stage.
Deputy for Food Insecurity and Nutrition at the National Food Agency, Nyoto Suwignyo, emphasized the important environmental and economic impacts of food waste in a press conference. In particular, food waste in Indonesia can feed an estimated 61-125 million people per year, which is a major cause of undernutrition or nutritional deficit in Indonesia.
